In this school exersice i have been conceptualizing an imaginary brand/company from scratch. This involved devising a creative brand name, designing a logo that captured the essence of the brand, and selecting a complementary color palette that resonated with the brand's identity. Additionally, I determined the ideal font to be used throughout the brand's website to ensure consistent and visually appealing communication.

After establishing the brand's visual identity, I translated my design concepts into a static website. Starting with a wireframe and mockup, I crafted a web layout. The final outcome was a static website that mirrored the brand's persona and effectively showcased the company's message and offerings.
